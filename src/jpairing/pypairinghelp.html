    <h3> Page Tab Descriptions</h3><p>
    <h4>Player List</h4><p>
    The Player List Page is where you enter and modify player data. For a new tournament this page is blank, while
    for an existing tournament this will contain the list of players.<p>
    <b>Add Player</b><p>
    The Add Player button creates an empty record for a new player. Enter a player name and rating in the respective fields (NB
    The notes field can be left blank and is intended for future use). The rating can either be from a torunament rating system
    or simply decided by the tournament director (it defaults to 0). It is used to provide an initial order for round 1 pairings.
    The data entry is free form so quality control is up to the user<p>
    Players can be "late entered" for the tournament (ie after the first round has been paired).
    Late entered players will be placed on board '0' and allocated 0 points for each unplayed round (NB this can be modifed later)<p>
    <b>Delete Player</b><p>
    Before the tournament starts a player can be removed from the entry list (eg if they are a duplicate entry, or are unable to attend)
    Cick on the row of the player to be removed and push the Delete Player button. <p>
    NB This option is unavailable after the first round has been paired<p>
    <b>Player Availibility</b><p>
    If a player is unable to play in a particular round, right click on the player concerned. This brings up the
    Player Availibility dialog. Each round that the player will be paired for has a tick. To remove a player from
    the pairings just click on the box (ie untick it) and press OK. The player will then be placed on Board '0'
    for that round. You are still able to enter a score for that player via the Pairings page if needed. (NB This has no
    effect for previously played rounds)<p>

    <h4>Pairing Page</h4><p>
    The Pairing Page allows you to enter the results for each round, and do pairings for the next round. The page will show
    the pairings for the current round (as signified by the spinner value at the bottom of the page). Results can be entered
    for each player in Match Points and Victory Points Columns. Results are updated when you push the Update button or
    change the current active round.<p>
    <b>Automatic</b><p>
    Produces the pairings for the next round. NB The current active round must be the most recent round of the tournament for this
    option to be available.<p>
    <b>Warning:</b>You can pair the next round before all results of the previous rounds have been entered. If this is done
    by mistake, use the Delete Current Round menu option (under Extras)<p>
    <b>Modify</b><p>
    If there is a need to change an existing pairing, the Modify button will show a dialog to let this happen. The dialog will
    show a set of existing pairings, for the current active round. To modify a pairing, highlight the pairing and choose
    Remove Player. This transfers the player to the right hand list. The enter the Board Number and Player ID for the player and
    choose Add Player to return them to the pairing list. To accept the set of modified pairings push Accept Pairings
    (NB All players must be paired first). If you wish to leave the pairings as they were just choose Cancel<p>
    <b>Update</b><p>
    This button updates the current scores and results. Use it if you want to see standings based on part results. Also use this
    if you are saving the data partway through a round<p>
    <b>Print</b><p>
    Allows you to print the current set of pairings<p>
    <b>Active Round</b><p>
    The Active Round Spinner sets the current round. To pair the next round (or to show current standings) set it to the last paired round.
    To modify results or pairings for previous rounds simply choose a previous round and select the appropriate action<p>

    <h4>Output</h4><p>
    The Output page shows Standings, Crosstables and Pairings (All described in the menu sction). <p>
    <b>Print</b><p>
    Sends the current output view to the printer. Opens a dialog to allow you so select which printer you use<p>
    Note: As the output windows are editable, you can add your own information before printing the content<p>

    <h3>Pairing System</h3><p>
    The pairing system for PyPairing 1.2 is a simple ordered pairing system. For the first round the playsr are sorted in rating
    order and placed on the boards according to the formula Player 1 on board 1, Player 2 on 2, down to board N.
    Then Player N+1 goes on board 1 etc For subsequent rounds the players are ordered by Match Points then Victory Points. The top 4
    players are on board 1, the next 4 on board 2 etc<p>
    Players can play the same opponents more than once.
    If the number of players being paired are not a multiple of 4, the program produces a set of 3 player pairings at the end
    to give every available player a game (ie 3 players left over = 1 3 player board, 2 players = 2 3 player board, 1 player =
    3 3 player boards).
